## About

The Nutritionist Health App Project came about as the final project of the HTML and CSS module of the 6-month Web Development Bootcamp I am taking. It was developed over the course of two days on day 22 of the bootcamp.

The aim of this project was to combine the skills I have acquired over the course of the past 22 days. The result is a flexible and responsive website, which features a navigation menu that adapts to screen size, transforming into a burger menu on smaller screens, a layout adapted to tablets and smartphones and user feedback animations.

This project showcases my skills and knowledge of HTML and CSS, including media queries, as well as one my first JavaScript programs in the shape of a calculator. I am proud of what I have accomplished in the short amount of time given and this project as a cornerstone of my path towards becoming a skillful web developer.
